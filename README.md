# VaahanVIDYA 🚗

## Project Overview

**VaahanVIDYA** is an intelligent vehicle-price-prediction system built using machine learning. It aims to help users estimate accurate resale values for cars (and potentially other vehicles) based on multiple features such as make, model, year, mileage, condition and more.

This project was developed by **Amogh Shukla** as part of research and practical work in the **AI_ML & DS** domain.

---

## Features

* End-to-end notebook with data load, cleaning, feature engineering and model building.
* Predictive model gives estimated price for a given vehicle.
* Built with Python and standard ML libraries (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib).
* Easily extendable: new features, vehicle types, or better models.

---

## Why This Project Matters

* Helps buyers and sellers make informed decisions in the used-vehicle market.
* Provides transparency and data-driven insights.
* Strong portfolio project demonstrating full ML workflow.
* Covers everything from raw data to a functional prediction system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
* Required libraries:

```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/AmoghShukla/VaahanVIDYA.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```
cd VaahanVIDYA
```

3. Open `Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb`.
4. Run all cells sequentially.
5. Modify or extend the notebook to try different models or features.

## Example Usage

After training the model, you can:

* Input details such as year, make, mileage, condition.
* Receive the estimated resale price.
* Compare the model output with actual market listings.

---

## Results & Performance


* **Model Type:** Random Forest / Linear Regression / XGBoost (your choice)
* **R² Score:** e.g., 0.87
* **RMSE:** e.g., ₹ 45,000
* **Top Features:** Year, Mileage, Make/Model

---

## Future Work

* Expand dataset with more diverse vehicle entries.
* Add features like accident history, service log, ownership type.
* Deploy as a web app using Flask / FastAPI.
* Integrate chatbot for conversational car-pricing help.
* Connect to live pricing APIs for dynamic predictions.
